### About me

Hi, my name is Egor. I graduated from the Academy of Communications in Vitebsk and now I am studying in the first year in Minsk. During training in Vitebsk, the main bias was on technical disciplines, so I almost didn't contact programming.
A month ago, I realized that I wanted to learn how to create applications and websites. After a couple of days of internet surfing, reading information and talking with an experienced programmer, I decided to start with C#.

Now I like to learn C# and programming. Of course, there are still a lot of things and terms that I don't understand, but every day they are getting smaller.

### My interests

Most of the time is spent studying, but I like a lot. I do not have several hobbies at the same time. Now I mainly study programming. I used to be fond of music, played musical instruments and worked with musical programs. Was engaged in various sports, Vietnamese martial art. Took part in concerts and all kinds of events.
